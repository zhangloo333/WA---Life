It is very difficult choosing which physician to see when you are suffering from chronic pain. Should you see a pain doctor, a surgeon, a neurologist, a chiropractor, a naturopath, an acupuncturist? The choices and options are bewildering! If you choose to see Dr. Attaman, you will find a physician that will thoroughly examine your case, and suggest treatment options for you that will draw from every specialty of medicine. Generally Dr. Attaman likes to try conservative treatment options such as physical therapy before invasive options such as pain reducing injections and surgery.

Dr. Attaman is always amazed at the treatment options available to patients who have been suffering from pain for even decades.\n\nDr. Attaman is board certified and Anesthesiology-fellowship trained in the medical subspecialty of Pain Medicine and Interventional Pain Management.

Early detection of coronary artery disease is critical, as nearly 50% of men and women will die of cardiovascular disease.

We now know that we can reduce the risk of heart attack or death from heart disease in up to 90% of individuals by appopriate changes in diet, exercise, and body weight, abstention from cigarette smoking, and if appropriate, medications. We can detect coronary/vascular disease BEFORE cardiac events occur by noninvasive testing, such as with EBT (which is a low radiation CT scan that evaluates for calcium in the coronary arteries as a marker for coronary disease, a so called \"Mammogram of the Heart\"), or by carotid IMT (which uses ultrasound to evaluate for vascular disease in the carotid artery).

Being a general pediatrician gives me a broad exposure to the pediatric experience.  I enjoy forming long-term relationships with families and providing anticipatory guidance to optimize health.  As a pediatric endocrinologist, I help patients and their families understand how hormones are influenced by what we eat and how we move our bodies. I routinely break down the conditions of insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome, prediabetes, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) and review how they are treated. During every patient encounter, I keep in mind that individual experiences inform future directions, and I look forward to joining patients on their respective journeys. \n<br/><br/> \nWhen not in the clinic, I enjoy spending time outdoors with my children, husband, and dog. If I am not hiking or beachcombing, I am likely cooking or cheering on the Seattle Sounders.",
